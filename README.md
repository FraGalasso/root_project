# root_project
This is my project with root data analysis framework for my  Laboratory-2 exam

The aim of the code is to simulate collision events (particles and proportions are hardcoded) and analyze them.
In the analysis part, I had to compare mass and width of instable particles (resonances) with differences in invariant mass of the other simulated particles, to find signals of the (simulated) decay in differences between distribution of particles with same and opposite charge (I did the same for only kaons and pions, too).
